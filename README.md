# FrugBirds
This project aims to study the relationship between the percentage of fruits within the bird species diet from the EltonTraits database and some morphological and ecological traits. We aim to predict the percentage of fruits in the diet of those species whose data was interpolated in the EltonTraits database.
We will use the AVONET database to obtain traits information.
